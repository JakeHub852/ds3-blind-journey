## 🪜 Into the Shrine

After bodying Iudex Gundyr (eventually), I opened the big, dramatic doors and was greeted by the iconic circular steps leading to **Firelink Shrine**. Chill atmosphere, lovely view, and a suspicious lack of immediate death. I knew it couldn't last.

## 🧍‍♂️ Duel with the Edge-Lord

Found a guy standing on a cliff, looking like a fashionable menace. Turns out it’s a katana-wielding maniac with zero chill and incredible speed. I challenged him approximately **12 times**, trying to be clever and knock him off the ledge.

Results:
- Got chopped to pieces every single time
- Rolled off myself twice in frustration
- Got parried multiple times (like, a lot)
- Learned that patience is not my strong suit here

Eventually gave up and pretended I had better things to do. I *will* return.

## 🔍 Exploring the Shrine

Wandered around the shrine grounds and picked up:
- A few **Embers**
- An **East-West Shield**
- A mild sense of direction

Inside, I discovered a bunch of friendlies(?) just standing around like they’re waiting for a bus. No one attacked me, so I guess we’re cool for now.

## 🫂 The Shrine Squad

- **Fire Keeper**: Talks like she’s narrating a funeral, but seems nice. Leveled up once. Felt powerful.
- **Andre the Blacksmith**: Big beard, bigger hammer. Love this guy already.
- **Shrine Handmaid**: Sells garbage at questionable prices. A Souls tradition.
- **Hawkwood the Deserter**: Sitting on some steps looking like the embodiment of "meh." Classic FromSoft sad dude energy. He mutters cryptic lines and radiates mild regret. I think we’ll get along.
- **Throne Sitters**: Just thrones. No sitters yet. Definitely ominous.

## 🔥 Coiled Sword & Linking the Shrine

Almost forgot — I jammed the **Coiled Sword** into the central bonfire to formally link Firelink Shrine as my base. Feels significant, lore-wise and mechanically. Feels like I’ve got a proper hub again, just like in the old days.
