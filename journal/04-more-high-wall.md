## 👑 Lady Emma & the Mission

Found a noble-looking woman, **Emma**, tucked away in a grand cathedral chamber. She spoke softly but with urgency, handing over a **Small Lothric Banner** and telling me to seek the Way of Blue. Seems important. She also mentioned something about the "High Priestess of Lothric Castle" — definitely not foreshadowing anything ominous.

## 🧊 Vordt of the Boreal Valley

Shortly after, I crossed a large courtyard and entered the fog wall of my next trial — **Vordt**, an armored beast-knight hybrid with a mean charge and frostbite buildup. First few attempts were panic rolls and cold sweats, but I locked in his tempo.

**Strategy:**  
- Stay under belly  
- Roll diagonally  
- Bait charge, punish with Claymore

Eventually took him down and felt like a true knight-slayer. The arena faded… and I knew it was time.

## 🏳️ Raise the Banner

Outside the cathedral, I raised Emma’s banner. Within seconds, **those white bat-like things** descended — familiar from past worlds — and silently carried me off to parts unknown. I didn’t resist.

## 🔥 Firelink Break: Upgrades & Gains

Returned to **Firelink Shrine** to cash in souls and get stronger:
- **Claymore upgraded to +2** with titanite shards  
- **Strength to 16** — now one-handing that glorious blade  
- **Vigor to 18** — more health, better longevity  

Also replaced my default helm with the **Lothric Knight Helm**, dropped by a Black Knight I finally outdueled after several “honorable” deaths. Looks great, feels better.

## 🧃 Summary

- **Met**: Emma the High Priestess  
- **Defeated**: Vordt of the Boreal Valley  
- **Looted**: Lothric Knight Helm  
- **Upgraded**: Claymore +2, STR 16, VIG 18

**Feeling**: Stronger, colder, and *very* into this Claymore now.
