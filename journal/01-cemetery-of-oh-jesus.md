## ⛰️ First Steps

Started the game. Got a sweeping cutscene that mentioned thrones, Lords of Cinder, and a lot of things I’ll pretend I understand until at least NG+. The voiceover said some names — Ludleth, Yhorm, some Watchers — all of whom I assume will be trying to kill me shortly.

I picked Warrior because I always go Quality on a first run. The gift selection was disappointing unless you love firebombs or random trash. Took the soul. Free currency. Easy choice.

Spawn in. Immediately strip off my chestplate like a true professional — gotta get those light rolls. Then I get to work swinging like a lunatic on the hollow dudes doing laps nearby. Pretty straightforward so far.

## 🐉 The Crystal Lizard Incident

Message on the ground says “turn back” or something ominous. Naturally, I press forward.

A massive crystal lizard, looking like a pissed-off geode, barrels toward me. I roll, swing, get pancaked, repeat. After a few “learning experiences,” I finally beat it and get a **Titanite Scale**. Not sure what it upgrades yet, but I’m claiming it as a moral victory.

## 🔥 Bonfire & Basic Movement

Lit the first bonfire on the hill like a responsible adult. Practiced jumping like it was 1999. Felt vaguely competent for 45 seconds.

## ⚔️ Boss Fog Appears

Enter: **Iudex Gundyr** — a statue-turned-nightmare who politely waits for me to pull a sword out of his chest before trying to club me into soup.

First few attempts were just me testing the waters — spacing, dodge timing, how long I can panic roll without stamina. On the third-ish try, I locked into his rhythm. His goo-monster phase caught me off guard but I spammed through it like a true Souls vet (read: flailed wildly with R1).

Victory.
