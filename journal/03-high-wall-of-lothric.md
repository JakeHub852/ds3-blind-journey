# 🏰 Journal 03: High Wall of Lothric — Dragons, Knights & Claymore

**Area**: High Wall of Lothric
**Build Goal**: Quality (STR/DEX) — keep it flexible, keep it sharp.

---

## 🐉 Dragons and Death

Crossed into High Wall of Lothric, immediately met a *huge* crowd of **hollows** — everything from scrappy **dogs** to axe-wielding **hollow soldiers**, plus those infamously tough **Lothric Knights**. Right off the bat, there’s a **dead dragon** lying motionless on the battlements, a grim reminder of how things end here.

Shortly after, an **alive wyvern** swooped in, breathing fire and clearing enemies for me. Unexpected help from a dragon — I’ll take it.

## ⚔️ Knight Duel and Tactical Retreat

Ran face-first into an **armored Lothric Knight** who promptly handed me my ass. After a few painful deaths, I realized stealth and patience were the order of the day. Managed to sneak past him and find the next **bonfire**, finally some sweet, sweet safety.

## 🦴 Estus Shard on the Anvil

Discovered my first **Estus Shard**, guarded by a pack of vicious **dogs** and axe-wielding **hollow soldiers**. Took a couple of hits but managed to grab it — more Estus means more survival, plain and simple.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The Thief Named **Greirat**

Freed a *thief NPC* named **Greirat of the Undead Settlement**. He asked me to deliver the **Blue Tearstone Ring**, a defensive ring that boosts your resilience when you’re low on health. He seems like a shady but useful ally.

## 🗡️ Claymore Secured

After surviving a hellish gauntlet of wyvern fire and hollow enemies, I managed to snag the **Claymore** — the iconic greatsword. Perfect for my quality build, balancing strength and dexterity beautifully.

---

## 🎯 Combat Philosophy Update

Gave parrying a fair shot, but honestly, I’m sticking to rolling for now. It’s less precise but more my style — especially against these fast, hard-hitting foes.

---
