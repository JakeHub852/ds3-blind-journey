## 🥶 First Impressions

A massive armored figure crawls forward on all fours, breathing cold mist and radiating menace. No words, no buildup — just raw frostbite energy and animalistic aggression. Whatever a “Boreal Valley” is, it can keep him.

## ⚔️ The Fight

- **Phase One**: Heavy mace swings, frontal cone attacks, straightforward if you stay tight under him.
- **Phase Two**: Enters a charging frenzy, coating the arena in frost and zooming like a rabid ice bull.

I learned quick:
- Don’t get greedy
- Roll diagonally when he charges
- Stay under him and punish his recovery

Won after a few brutal tries. No shame.

## 🧠 Vibes & Lore

Definitely not just a knight — something twisted, frozen, deformed. His bestial posture hints at degradation, like he *was* human but isn’t anymore. Emma called him one of the "watchdogs of the Boreal Valley." There's more to that title — and to what he’s guarding.

## 🏁 Aftermath

- Defeating him opened the path forward: raising Emma’s banner let me continue.  
- The music, arena, and pacing all screamed: “This world is colder than it looks.”

*“Was he a knight cursed into madness, or a beast wrapped in armor and memory?”*
