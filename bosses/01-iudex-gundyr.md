## 🧠 Thoughts

Looked like a statue, turned out to be a boss. Classic Souls. Cool intro — very "judge of the dead" vibes. Second phase turns into a writhing sludge demon from another dimension, which I did *not* see coming.

## 💀 Attempts

1. Rolled too early.  
2. Forgot about stamina.  
3. Panicked.  
4. Won by accident. Glory to R1 spam.

## 🏆 First Takeaway Boss

Gundyr is the Souls equivalent of being thrown into the deep end.
