# 📓 Lore & Observations

> Ongoing notes, speculations, and half-formed theories from my blind DS3 playthrough. Some of this might be nonsense. Some of it might be true. Time will tell.

## 🔥 Firelink Shrine

* There’s a **Coiled Sword** embedded in the bonfire. Is this the same sword from Iudex Gundyr? Almost ritualistic. Seems to *connect* Firelink to the rest of the world.
* **Firelink Shrine** again, but... not the same one from DS1. Familiar architecture, but dreamlike. Faded echoes. Alternate timeline? Repetition of cycles?
* **Five thrones**, all labeled, all empty. Implies major players need to return or be dealt with.
* The **Fire Keeper** feels like a spiritual successor to DS1’s version — same title, same role, but more involved.
* **Andre** is 100% the blacksmith from DS1. No doubt. Same voice, same moves, same hammer. Immortality? Time loop? This confirms shared world.
* **Shrine Handmaid** references past lands and sells strange gear. Her presence implies much has already happened.
* **Hawkwood**: Introduces himself as “unfit.” Major Crestfallen vibes. Possibly a parallel or echo of the DS1 NPC who slowly goes hollow.

## 🧍‍♂️ Katana Cliff Guy

* Clearly placed to test players who wander. Definitely optional — no intro, no tutorial boss energy.
* His presence feels symbolic: a lone swordsman guarding the outer edge of reality.
* Does he represent temptation? Overconfidence? The fragility of pride? Or am I just salty?

## 🔥 The World So Far

* **Linking the fire** still seems to be the goal, but no one is quite explaining why.
* There’s a recurring sense of **cycles repeating** — not just narratively, but spatially and spiritually.
* Enemies feel like husks of forgotten souls. Even early mobs seem trapped in their own patterns.
* Lots of references to **past Lords** and **Thrones**. Almost like I’m walking the paths of failed heroes.

## 🧃 Other Notes

* **Embers** seem like a mix between Humanity (DS1) and Effigies (DS2), but they boost health and maybe trigger multiplayer? Need testing.
* Time and space seem... loose. Locations blend together like fragments of memory.
* The architecture in Firelink feels constructed from old worlds. Like a graveyard of previous lives.
* It’s quiet here — almost *too* quiet. Something feels *paused*.

## ❓ Open Questions

* Who were the original five throne occupants?
* What exactly is the Coiled Sword, and why was it used to "unlock" Firelink?
* Is this world *after* DS1? DS2? A forked timeline? Reincarnated myth?
* Will Hawkwood vanish? Turn hostile? Lead me somewhere?
* Why does everyone act like I’m doomed?
