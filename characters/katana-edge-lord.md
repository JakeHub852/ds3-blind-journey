# Katana Edge-Lord

Fashionably deadly and brutally efficient. This samurai-looking dude on the cliff challenged me to a duel that ended with me getting chopped to pieces every time.

Tried to cheat him off the edge about a dozen times, failed spectacularly.

Definitely not someone to mess with early on, but I’ll be back—hopefully with better skills.
