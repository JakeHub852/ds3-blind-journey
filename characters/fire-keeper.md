# Fire Keeper

The cryptic lady who levels you up. Talks like she’s narrating a funeral but seems genuinely kind. Has the job of tending the bonfires and guiding lost undead like me.

Met at Firelink Shrine after Iudex Gundyr. Gave me that sweet level-up boost that felt like a win.

She’s probably got way more going on than she lets on. Classic FromSoft mystery.
