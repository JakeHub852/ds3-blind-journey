# Hawkwood the Deserter

Sitting on the steps looking like he’s given up on life and maybe the whole world. Classic FromSoft sad lad archetype: cryptic, melancholic, and full of regret.

The kind of guy you’d have a long drink with if you want to share existential dread and vague lore tidbits.

Introduced at Firelink Shrine, he’s one to watch as the story unfolds.
