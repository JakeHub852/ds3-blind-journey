# 👑 Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle

**Location**: Lothric Cathedral (High Wall of Lothric)  
**Role**: Guide, Banner Bearer, Keeper of Lore

---

## First Encounter

Found seated alone in a grand, echoing cathedral past the knights and beasts of Lothric. Despite the surrounding ruin, Emma remains composed and regal. She entrusted me with the **Small Lothric Banner**, a signal of passage and purpose — and perhaps faith.

## Personality & Presence

- Calm, ceremonial, and unshaken by chaos  
- Speaks of sacred duties and fading order  
- Radiates quiet dignity and latent sorrow  

---

## Notes

- Her mention of the **Way of Blue** and the **High Priestess** role hints at deeper lore connections  
- Likely tied to the royal lineage or their last remaining servants  
- Her time may be limited… but her message feels weighty
